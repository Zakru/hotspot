# Hotspot

Hotspot is a puzzle platformer game I made with
[LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) for
[LÖVE Jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/love2d-jam-2020) as my first ever
jam participation. (It got 2nd place overall, as well!)

`.love` packages and Windows builds can be downloaded from the itch.io
page over at
[https://zakru.itch.io/hotspot](https://zakru.itch.io/hotspot).
